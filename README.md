# Time-series-data-analysis
This analysis provides an initial overview of a larger project focused on forecasting future prices of a gas commodity using time series data. It involves exploratory data analysis, visualization, and manipulation to better understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the commodityâ€™s historical prices.

Key components of the analysis include examining seasonality to identify trends and applying multiplicative seasonality models to understand the proportional relationship between seasonal effects and overall trends. Autocorrelation is also investigated, highlighting the influence of past values on current prices and confirming the presence of temporal dependencies in the data.
